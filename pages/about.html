        <p>This website was made for the express purpose of cataloging mutliple articles of media, whether that be video
            games, old photgraphs, even NFTs. I believe in making everything on the internet permanent. If the
            blockchain fails, then no matter how...unpleasent...NFTs are to look at, they are still <i>art</i>. That's
            the important take-away with this site. I want people to realize that art is objectively anything that
            someone puts their minds to. Any kind of process of natural thought leads to art. This could be actual
            <i>art</i>, like a painting or an illustration. This could also be stuff like music and other things. I will
            always try to give credit where credit is due, but if you have an issue you may file a complaint with the
            form below.</p>
